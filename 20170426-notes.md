There were two main talks:

* **connection-local variables** - devops / netops with tramp by
  Michael Albinus. The full slides are available as (of course) org
  file: [20170426-connection-local.org](20170426-connection-local.org)

* **yasnippets** by Francesc Elies

Once the scheduled talks are over it's open mic! Did you discover a new
package, learned something about Elisp, or just used Emacs for developing a
cool project, then we want to hear about it!

One of lightning talks was Arne demoing the
[Emacs Mastodon client](https://github.com/jdenen/mastodon.el)

Arne also talked about applying sound to images with

Klaus showed us how to browse without a mouse using

and other tricks

Jack inspired us to use emacs any way we want, giving a
