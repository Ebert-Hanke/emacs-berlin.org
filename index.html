      <h3>Format</h3>

      <p>For the first meetup (and possibly consequent one) we are going to try a novel format:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>We highly encourage everybody to show something to the rest</li>
        <li>You get up to 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Prepare some notes beforehand (org-mode or markdown), put them in a gist, and share the link on the mailing list</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This last part is so people can easily follow along on their own machine, and so they have a reference to try the stuff you showed at home. Things to include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>elpa/melpa packages used
        <li>urls to other elisp code, like stuff from EmacsWiki
        <li>names of functions/commands
        <li>key bindings
        <li>custom configuration snippets
      </ul>

      <p>No need to overdo it. Showing this one-command-I-discovered-last-week is also fine. Anything (remotely) related to Emacs goes.</p>
      <p>If you feel like you’re really too much a beginner, you could still use your ten minutes to get input from the rest of the group. Maybe there's something you’d like to be able to do, but you're not sure how. Or you can skip this part entirely and simply let yourself be inspired.</p>
      <p>Afterwards we should have plenty of time left to chat, ask questions and swap ideas.</p>
