      <h3>Format</h3>

      <p>For the first meetup (and possibly consequent one) we are going to try a novel format:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Everybody is expected to show something to the rest</li>
        <li>You get up to 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Prepare some notes beforehand (markdown), put them in a gist, and share the link on the mailing list</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This last part is so people can easily follow along on their own machine, and so they have a reference to try the stuff you showed at home. Things to include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>elpa/melpa packages used
        <li>urls to other elisp code, like stuff from EmacsWiki
        <li>names of functions/commands
        <li>key bindings
        <li>custom configuration snippets
      </ul>

      <p>No need to overdo it. Showing this one-command-I-discovered-last-week is also fine. Anything (remotely) related to Emacs goes. If you feel like you’re really too much a beginner, then just think about something you’d like to be able to achieve, and ask the group for suggestions.</p>
