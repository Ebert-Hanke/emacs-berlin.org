# `C-u 2017 M-x new-year RET`

The first meetup in 2017 will be on **January 25th**, back at our
traditional host Contentful, with two talks:

**Introduction to [Magit](https://magit.vc/) in Spacemacs** â€” by [Julia](https://twitter.com/anderspree)
<br>
How I became the only one at work that loves Rebasing.

[Jack Rusher](http://jackrusher.com/) uses Emacs for basically
everything for 30+ years and will **surprise us with something cool**!

There will also be time for lightning talks/demos and some food.
