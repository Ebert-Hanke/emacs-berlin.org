### Talks

#### "Introduction to Magit in Spacemacs" — by [Julia](https://twitter.com/anderspree)

How I became the only one at work that loves Rebasing.

#### "Org-mode tables and Spreadsheet Functionality" - by [Til](https://twitter.com/til)

Org-mode takes your ASCII art tables, and turns them into magic. Automatic formatting, moving columns or rows, it's all a breeze. With formulas and computed cells they even become full spreadsheets.

### Lightning talks

#### "Making music inside of Emacs" — by [Fredrik](https://twitter.com/quesebifurcan)

A brief overview of a compositional project, featuring Clojure, Python and Lilypond. We'll start out with plain Clojure data structures and eventually end up with an engraved score and a recording.

#### "general-close" — by Andreas

#### "New features in Emacs 25.1" — by [Andy](https://twitter.com/pxlpnk)

#### "Treating Markdown as if it's org-mode" — by [Arne](https://twitter.com/plexus)
