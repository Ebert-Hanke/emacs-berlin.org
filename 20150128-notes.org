We expected a small group, but in the end had 9 people. Not bad for
Emacs Berlin :)

There was a suggestion to develop a function that could generically
find and close the last open delimiter, and several guys set off working on that.

We had someone who wants to use Emacs to write a book. He used word
before, now uses LaTeX, is looking at ConTeXt, and is generally sold
on Emacs, although a few small annoyances remain.

We also had a long time vimmer visiting and asking many questions.
