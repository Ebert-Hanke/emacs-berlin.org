#+TITLE: about keyboard macros
#+AUTHOR: Marco
* basics

macros can help ease repetetive keyboard action.

** generic

*** record

- start recording.
- press some keys.
- finalize recording.

==> have a macro.

*** replay

the macro can be replayed!

no shit Sherlock!

** concrete

*** record

- function key <f3>
- action: type something: e.g. "emacs ".
- <f4>

stop recording any time with C-g.

*** replay

- <f4>

* beyond the basics

** record (and some replay)

- start alternatives:
  - <f3>
  - key sequence :: C-x (
  - command :: M-x kmacro-start-macro
- finalize recording:
  - C-x )
  - M-x kmacro-end-macro

  - <f4>
  - M-x kmacro-end-or-call-macro

  - C-x e
  - M-x kmacro-end-and-call-macro
  - C-x e e e

** replay a number of times

- have a macro.
- prefix argument indicates number of repeats of the macro.
  #+begin_example
      e.g. C-u 42 C-x e
  #+end_example
- special prefix argument 0.
  ==> repeat until error.
  - use case: do something for all occurances.

** replay for every line in region

C-x C-k r       apply-macro-to-region-lines

* view last macro

C-x C-k C-v     kmacro-view-macro-repeat

* edit a kmacro

- C-x C-k E :: M-x edit-last-kbd-macro .
- do some edits.
- C-c C-c :: apply the edits.
- enjoy the changes.

* step through a macro

C-x C-k SPC     kmacro-step-edit-macro

* counter

- there is a counter for use with keyboard macros.
- C-x C-k C-c :: M-x kmacro-set-counter.
- <f3> or C-x C-k C-i :: M-x kmacro-insert-counter.
  - automatically +1 to the counter .
  - detail :: prefix-arg defines the amount to sum.
- C-x C-k C-f :: M-x kmacro-set-format.
     format strings look like "%03d".

* break the flow

- C-x q :: give control to the user.
- C-u C-x q :: enter recursive edit.

* bind a macro to key

- C-x C-k b  kmacro-bind-to-key

** bind to a register

- C-x C-k x register :: kmacro-to-register
- C-x r j register ::

* more ways to edit

- C-x C-k l  kmacro-edit-lossage
- C-x C-k e  edit-kbd-macro

* save a macro

- name a macro.
  - C-x C-k n       kmacro-name-last-macro

- let a macro survive the switch off.  (aka persistence)
  - name the macro.
  - switch to a writable buffer.
  - M-x insert-kbd-macro
    - choose the named macro.
  - ==> find code which defines the macro.  insert that in your config
    file.

* macro ring

- there is a ring (aka list) which keeps the accessible macros.  (without the
  named macros, I think.)
- the head of that ring is the "last macro".
- operations on the ring.

C-x C-k C-n     kmacro-cycle-ring-next
C-x C-k C-p     kmacro-cycle-ring-previous
C-x C-k C-d     kmacro-delete-ring-head
C-x C-k C-t     kmacro-swap-ring
C-x C-k C-l     kmacro-call-ring-2nd-repeat

* more

** repeat movement

- M-x repeat

** performance

:(

** documentation

- [[info:emacs#Keyboard%20Macros][info:emacs#Keyboard Macros]]
  (info "(emacs) Keyboard Macros")
- source code.

** lisp macros

- keyboard macros vs. lisp macros.
  - it's not the same.

** as always...

- get creative!
- do as you like!
- thanks!
