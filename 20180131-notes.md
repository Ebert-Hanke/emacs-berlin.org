<div class="row"><div class="large-12 columns">

Using our collective wisdom we did some mob programming and created a
useful litte function to undo the latest commit of a git repository.
We also managed to get the \*scratch\* buffer into a state where it
wouldn't display its contents anymore and had to start over. And
learnt the basics of the prefix argument.

```elisp
(defun magit/undo-last-commit (number-of-commits)
  "Undoes the latest commit or commits without loosing changes"
  (interactive "P")
  (let ((num (if (numberp number-of-commits)
                 number-of-commits
               1)))
    (magit-reset (format "HEAD^%s" num))))
```
