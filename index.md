We are Emacs enthusiasts in Berlin. This group is still brand new, the paint is still wet.

We have a mailing list! To join the mailing list, simply send an email to [emacsberlin@librelist.com](mailto:emacsberlin@librelist.com). You will be automatically subscribed. Then, feel free to send a second email introducing yourself!

Mailing list archives can be found at [Librelist](http://librelist.com/browser/emacsberlin/).

You can also find us on Freenode: [#emacs-berlin](irc://chat.freenode.net/emacs-berlin)

## Format

For the first meetup we tried a novel format:

* We highly encourage everybody to show something to the rest
* Everybody is expected to show something to the rest
* You get up to 10 minutes
* Prepare some notes beforehand (preferably using org-mode), put them in a gist, and     share the link on the mailing list

This last part is so people can easily follow along on their own machine, and so they have a reference to try the stuff you showed at home. Things to include

* elpa/melpa packages used
* urls to other elisp code, like stuff from EmacsWiki
* names of functions/commands
* key bindings
* custom configuration snippets

No need to overdo it. Showing this one-command-I-discovered-last-week is also fine. Anything (remotely) related to Emacs goes.

If you feel like you’re really too much a beginner, you could still use your ten minutes to get input from the rest of the group. Maybe there's something you’d like to be able to do, but you're not sure how. Or you can skip this part entirely and simply let yourself be inspired.

Afterwards we should have plenty of time left to chat, ask questions and swap ideas.

On the second meeting we didn't use any specific structure, but just
formed ad-hoc groups that hacked together on various topics of
interest which we collected before the meeting.
