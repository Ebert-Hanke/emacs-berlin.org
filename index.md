We are Emacs enthusiasts in Berlin, meeting every last Wednesday of
the month (`<%%(diary-float t 3 -1)>` in org-mode). The group is
relatively new, the paint is slowly getting dry.

The best way to stay posted is through our mailing list.
[Sign up](https://mailb.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-berlin) and meet
your fellow Emacsers, or have a look at the
[mailing list archives](https://mailb.org/pipermail/emacs-berlin/).

Feel free to send an email introducing yourself after subscribing!

You can also chat with us on irc:

## Format

We try to keep the structure pretty loose, we are not the typical
"three half hour talks" type of user group. People can just hack
together on whatever they find interesting, help each other to make
their Emacs setups even more awesome, or share some setup and code
with the group.

The
[Github repo](https://github.com/emacs-berlin/emacs-berlin.org/issues)
and the
[mailing list](https://mailb.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-berlin) can be
used to propose topics.

## Beginner's Guarantee

If you would like a basic introduction to Emacs, or you're starting
out and have some questions, then we are more than happy to help
you. Just show up to a meeting, and we guarantee there will be
somebody to help you up to speed.

## Members
