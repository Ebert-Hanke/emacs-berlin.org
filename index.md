## Beginner's Guarantee

If you would like a basic introduction to Emacs, or you're starting
out and have some questions, then we are more than happy to help
you. Just show up to a meeting, and we guarantee there will be
somebody to help you up to speed.

## Format

We try to keep the structure pretty loose, we are not the typical
"three half hour talks" type of user group. There are often small
impromptu presentations or demos. For the rest people just hack
together on whatever they find interesting, help each other to make
their Emacs setups even more awesome, or chat about whatever they've
been up to, Emacs related, or not.

[GitHub Issues][ghi] and the [mailing list][ml] can be used to propose
topics.

## Members

People that show up to our meetings regularly or on occasion. Links go
to their emacs config.
