We are Emacs enthusiasts in Berlin, meeting every last Wednesday of the month (`<%%(diary-float t 3 -1)>` in org-mode). The group is relatively new, the paint is slowly getting dry.

The best way to stay posted is through our mailing list.
[Sign up](https://mailb.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-berlin) and meet your fellow Emacsers, or have a look at the [mailing list archives](https://mailb.org/pipermail/emacs-berlin/).

Feel free to send an email introducing yourself after subscribing!

## Format

We try to keep the structure pretty loose, we are not the typical "three half hour talks" type of user group. People can just hack together on whatever they find interesting, help each other to make their Emacs setups even more awesome, or share some setup and code with the group.

The [Github repo](https://github.com/emacs-berlin/emacs-berlin.org/issues) and the [mailing list](https://mailb.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-berlin) can be used to propose topics.

## Members

People that show up to our meetings regularly or on occasion. Links go to their emacs config.
