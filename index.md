## Beginner's Guarantee

If you would like a basic introduction to Emacs, or you're starting
out and have some questions, then we are more than happy to help
you. Just show up to a meeting, and we guarantee there will be
somebody to help you up to speed.

## Talks

Talks are 20 minutes + 5 min Q&A, and should be loosely related to Emacs.
Lightning talks are 5 minutes + 5 minutes Q&A, and can be about anything. The
only "rule" for lightning talks is "keep it short, keep it interesting".

At the moment the best place to propose talks is on the [mailing list][ml].

<!-- ## Format -->

<!-- We try to keep the structure pretty loose, we are not the typical -->
<!-- "three half hour talks" type of user group. There are often small -->
<!-- impromptu presentations or demos. For the rest people just hack -->
<!-- together on whatever they find interesting, help each other to make -->
<!-- their Emacs setups even more awesome, or chat about whatever they've -->
<!-- been up to, Emacs related, or not. -->

<!-- [GitHub Issues][ghi] and the [mailing list][ml] can be used to propose -->
<!-- topics. -->

## Code of Conduct

Emacs Berlin has adopted the
[Berlin Code of Conduct](http://berlincodeofconduct.org/), all who attend our
events or participate on our mailing list are expected to have read this
document, and to behave accordingly.
