# (emacs-berlin)

We are Emacs enthusiasts in Berlin. This group is still brand new, the paint is still wet.

We have a mailing list! To join the mailing list, simply send an email to [emacsberlin@librelist.com](mailto:emacsberlin@librelist.com). You will be automatically subscribed. Then, feel free to send a second email introducing yourself!

Mailing list archives can be found at [Librelist](http://librelist.com/browser/emacsberlin/).

Our first meetup will be held Thursday 27 March 2014 at 19:30 at the [Travis CI office](https://gist.github.com/svenfuchs/5364262).
