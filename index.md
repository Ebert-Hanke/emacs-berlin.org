We are Emacs enthusiasts in Berlin, meeting every last Wednesday of the month (`<%%(diary-float t 3 -1)>` in org-mode). The group is relatively new, the paint is slowly getting dry.

The best way to stay posted is through our mailing list.
[Sign up](https://mailb.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-berlin) and meet your fellow Emacsers, or have a look at the [mailing list archives](https://mailb.org/pipermail/emacs-berlin/).

# One year anniversary - 25 March 2015 -

On 27 March 2014 a handful of people got together at the former Travis
Office at Moritzplatz for the very first Emacs Berlin meetup.

This means that our next meetup on **25 March 2015** will be our one year
anniversary.

Because of this we'd like to make a little more effort to make this a great
day, and to invite some people that maybe haven't found the way to our
little corner of the geekyverse yet.

- We are planning to do lightning talks in the 5 min + 5 min Q&A format. Please send an email to the mailing list if you have a topic.

- An "introduction to Emacs" talk, suitable for people coming from Notepad, so to speak.

- Ask a friend to join you, bring your co-workers, friends and family, everyone is welcome.

- Have some pizzas (meat, vegetarian & vegan) and drinks (alcoholic and non alcoholic).

We are all looking forward to the next meetup and to you.

Save the date!

## Format

We try to keep the structure pretty loose, we are not the typical "three half hour talks" type of user group. People can just hack together on whatever they find interesting, help each other to make their Emacs setups even more awesome, or share some setup and code with the group.

The [Github repo](https://github.com/emacs-berlin/emacs-berlin.org/issues) and the [mailing list](https://mailb.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-berlin) can be used to propose topics.

## Members
