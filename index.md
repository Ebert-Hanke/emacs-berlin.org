# (emacs-berlin)

We are Emacs enthusiasts in Berlin. This group is still brand new, the paint is still wet.

We have a mailing list! To join the mailing list, simply send an email to [emacsberlin@librelist.com](mailto:emacsberlin@librelist.com). You will be automatically subscribed. Then, feel free to send a second email introducing yourself!

Mailing list archives can be found at [Librelist](http://librelist.com/browser/emacsberlin/).

Our first meetup will be held Thursday 27 March 2014 at 19:30 at the [Travis CI office](https://gist.github.com/svenfuchs/5364262).

## Format

For the first meetup (and possibly consequent one) we are going to try a novel format:

* Everybody is expected to show something to the rest
* You get up to 10 minutes
* Prepare some notes beforehand (markdown), put them in a gist, and share the link on the mailing list

This last part is so people can easily follow along on their own machine, and so they have a reference to try the stuff you showed at home. Things to include

* elpa/melpa packages used
* urls to other elisp code, like stuff from EmacsWiki
* names of functions/commands
* key bindings
* custom configuration snippets

No need to overdo it. Showing this one-command-I-discovered-last-week is also fine.
Anything (remotely) related to Emacs goes. If you feel like you're really too much a beginner, then just think about something you'd like to be able to achieve, and ask the group for suggestions.
