## Meetup 28 September 2016, 19:00

location: [Contentful](http://contentful.com)
[Ritterstr. 12-14, 10969 Berlin](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=52.501438558101654&mlon=13.410902917385101#map=19/52.50144/13.41090&layers=N)

Go into the courtyard, the place is on your left.

### Talks

#### "Introduction to Magit in Spacemacs" — by [Julia](https://twitter.com/anderspree)

How I became the only one at work that loves Rebasing.

#### "Org-mode tables and Spreadsheet Functionality" - by [Til](https://twitter.com/til)

Org-mode takes your ASCII art tables, and turns them into magic. Automatic formatting, moving columns or rows, it's all a breeze. With formulas and computed cells they even become full spreadsheets.

### Lightning talks

#### "Making music inside of Emacs" — by [Fredrik](https://twitter.com/quesebifurcan)

A brief overview of a compositional project, featuring Clojure, Python and Lilypond. We'll start out with plain Clojure data structures and eventually end up with an engraved score and a recording.

#### "general-close" — by Andreas

#### "New features in Emacs 25.1" — by [Andy](https://twitter.com/pxlpnk)

#### "Treating Markdown as if it's org-mode" — by [Arne](https://twitter.com/plexus)

org-mode is a very powerful package, and a great format, but support for it outside Emacs' ecosystem is limited, so many of us end up using Markdown. We'll see how to get some of that org-mode feel when editing Markdown.

## Beginner's Guarantee

If you would like a basic introduction to Emacs, or you're starting
out and have some questions, then we are more than happy to help
you. Just show up to a meeting, and we guarantee there will be
somebody to help you up to speed.

## Talks

Talks are 20 minutes + 5 min Q&A, and should be loosely related to Emacs.
Lightning talks are 5 minutes + 5 minutes Q&A, and can be about anything. The
only "rule" for lightning talks is "keep it short, keep it interesting".

At the moment the best place to propose talks is on the [mailing list][ml].

<!-- ## Format -->

<!-- We try to keep the structure pretty loose, we are not the typical -->
<!-- "three half hour talks" type of user group. There are often small -->
<!-- impromptu presentations or demos. For the rest people just hack -->
<!-- together on whatever they find interesting, help each other to make -->
<!-- their Emacs setups even more awesome, or chat about whatever they've -->
<!-- been up to, Emacs related, or not. -->

<!-- [GitHub Issues][ghi] and the [mailing list][ml] can be used to propose -->
<!-- topics. -->

## Code of Conduct

Emacs Berlin has adopted the
[Berlin Code of Conduct](http://berlincodeofconduct.org/), all who attend our
events or participate on our mailing list are expected to have read this
document, and to behave accordingly.
