  We found out thanks to Jano about better-defaults, which sets a
  binding for hippie-expand, which led to a discussion about
  completion/expanding packages and built-ins.

  We had Andreas visiting, the maintainer of python-mode. He showed us
  [[https://launchpad.net/s-x-emacs-werkstatt][s-x-emacs-workstatt]], an elaborate package for manipulating all kinds
  of text objects. Seems interesting but could use some more PR or
  beginner documentation.

  We ended up having a discussion about the limitations of org-babel's
  unified model of dealing with different languages.
