# One year anniversary - 25 March 2015 -

On 27 March 2014 a handful of people got together at the former Travis
Office at Moritzplatz for the very first Emacs Berlin meetup.

This means that our next meetup on **25 March 2015** will be our one year
anniversary.

Because of this we'd like to make a little more effort to make this a great
day, and to invite some people that maybe haven't found the way to our
little corner of the geekyverse yet.

- We are planning to do lightning talks in the 5 min + 5 min Q&A format. Please send an email to the mailing list if you have a topic.

- An "introduction to Emacs" talk, suitable for people coming from Notepad, so to speak.

- Ask a friend to join you, bring your co-workers, friends and family, everyone is welcome.

- Have some pizzas (meat, vegetarian & vegan) and drinks (alcoholic and non alcoholic).

We are all looking forward to the next meetup and to you.
